//! # BettaPay Settlement Contract
//!
//! This module provides the core implementation of the settlement contract for BettaPay.
//! It is responsible for managing merchant registration, settlement rules, and the payment storage architecture.
//!
//! ## Merchant Rules
//!
//! The contract maintains a registry of authorized merchants. For each registered merchant,
//! an admin can configure specific settlement rules defined by the `SettlementRule` struct.
//! A settlement rule dictates:
//! - **Platform Fee (BPS)**: The fee collected by the platform.
//! - **Network Fee (BPS)**: The fee collected by the network.
//! - **Settlement Delay**: The delay in ledger sequences before a settlement can occur.
//! - **Auto-settle**: A flag indicating whether auto-settlement is enabled.
//!
//! If a merchant lacks a specific rule, the system falls back to an admin-configured global default rule,
//! and ultimately to a hardcoded bootstrap default rule if necessary.
//!
//! ## Payment Storage Architecture
//!
//! Payments are tracked and stored using a unique 32-byte reference (`BytesN<32>`).
//! When `store_payment_reference` is invoked, the contract calculates the exact fee split
//! (platform fee, network fee, and net merchant amount) based on the merchant's effective settlement rule.
//!
//! The resulting data is persisted in a `PaymentRecord`, which encapsulates:
//! - The calculated amounts and fee BPS.
//! - The ledger sequence of the transaction.
//! - Settlement delay and auto-settle configurations.
//!
//! The contract leverages different `DataKey` variants (`Admin`, `Merchant`, `Rule`, `Payment`, etc.)
//! to securely organize persistent and instance storage, while applying TTL extensions to ensure
//! active records remain available and do not expire prematurely.
//!
//! ## Upgrade Process
//!
//! [`SettlementContract::upgrade`] replaces the Wasm and nothing else. That is
//! what makes it safe, and also why changing a stored type is a separate
//! problem: nothing converts existing entries, and nothing checks that they
//! still match the types the new code expects. A mismatched read fails at
//! runtime, after the upgrade has already landed.
//!
//! 1. Wasm upgrades replace code only; every storage entry survives untouched.
//! 2. Storage migrations run **inside the upgraded contract**, as an
//!    admin-gated `migrate` entry point — not from a separate migration
//!    contract. A contract can only reach its own storage, so another contract
//!    has no access path to `Payment`, `Merchant` or `Rule` entries.
//! 3. Ship the old type definition in the same Wasm as the new one. A
//!    `#[contracttype]` struct is encoded by field name, so a `PaymentRecord`
//!    written before a new field existed will not deserialise into the new
//!    struct — the old type is what keeps those entries readable.
//! 4. Order is: upgrade the Wasm, then call `migrate`, then verify the
//!    post-upgrade state, then remove the migration code in a later upgrade.
//! 5. `Payment(BytesN<32>)`, `Merchant(Address)` and `Rule(Address)` are keyed
//!    by value and Soroban cannot enumerate storage keys — which is why
//!    [`SettlementContract::get_payments`] takes the references from the
//!    caller. Convert these lazily on read, or pass the keys in explicitly.
//! 6. Call `extend_ttl` on anything the migration rewrites: `set` alone does
//!    not extend an entry's life, so a migrated record would otherwise expire
//!    sooner than an untouched one.
//!
//! Full guidance, including worked examples and how to test a migration, is in
//! [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](https://github.com/Betta-Pay/BettaPay-Contract/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md).
